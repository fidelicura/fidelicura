# Motivation

To be honest, I'm not such a valuable person in this world, but I want to make people more intelligent. No hidden subtext. We just need smart people.
My point is simple, e.g. black hat hacking. Hacking is thankless task because you don't improve that systems that you hack. No impact on the world. No even impact for your system.

# Manifest

1) **Privacy**: "I have nothing to hide, but I also have **nothing** I want to share with you";
2) **Knowledge**: "Science teaching knowledge should be free, but bookprinting is the **only** alternative in paid version of knowledge";
3) **Software**: "Software should be open-source, but it is fine to make it **paid to use**, e.g. open-source SaaS, because _work must be paid in the capitalist world_";
4) **Fraud**: "No fraud of any type";

# Ð¡larifications

Let's be honest, we both know that this won't work and it is utopia, but I don't pretend this to be the best of all kinds.
Everyone has to bite their own bullets. Multiple times.
